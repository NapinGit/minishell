# minishell
A smaller version of bash,

The idea of this project was to create a program acting like bash,
 and some custom builtins like :
 
◦ echo and the option -n

◦ cd

◦ pwd without any option

◦ export without any option

◦ unset without any option

◦ env without any option and argument

◦ exit without any option

The other builtins are the one from bash library.

Usage : You should type "make" so everything will compile creating the executable ./minishell

Then you could run the executable with "./minishell"

this project was made in collaboration with Toueis https://github.com/toueis
